# PetBnB

Airbnb, but for pets. Ever plan a vacation, but worried about your pets? We got you covered!

## Some deets
* A dynamic web app
* Allows entry and verification of addresses, picture upload, and dynamically creates content to list onto the webpage.
* Login and register functionality.
* Cats, Dogs and more! What are you waiting for?

## Tech we used
* Built on vanilla js (yeah, it was a pain) and express for the backend.
* API calls to HERE maps, because Google wants us to pay.

## What we learned
* How to dynamically create HTML objects.
* Where to find nice pet pictures.
* CSS Sucks, really.
* Sometimes stuff just works ¯\(ツ)/¯
* And sometimes, it doesn't, no matter what you do.

## Where to go from here
* Pet tracking facilities
* Sort pets based on user preference, ML to understand patterns
